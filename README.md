# DigitalClock
Developed an interactive web application that displays the current time with a dynamic, circular clock interface.

The DigitalClock project is an interactive web application that displays the current time using a visually appealing circular clock interface. The HTML structure defines three distinct circles for hours, minutes, and seconds, color-coded in vibrant pink, green, and yellow respectively, with SVG elements for smooth animations. The CSS ensures a clean, modern look with a dark background, positioning the clock at the center and adding glowing shadows for a polished, high-tech feel. The JavaScript dynamically updates the time and date every second, formats the time in a 12-hour format, and animates the clock hands using stroke offsets and rotations. Additionally, it displays the current AM/PM status and full date, integrating front-end technologies seamlessly for a dynamic and engaging user experience.
